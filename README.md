# Smart-Object-Detection\nAn innovative Android application showcasing the implementation of a trained TensorFlow Lite Object detector file.\n\nThe initial version of this application was cloned from the [official TensorFlow android example](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/android).\n\nIf you're new to TensorFlow object detection APIs, consider reading this series of 3 articles that describe end to end setup, training, and testing of a TensorFlow model on mobile.
The articles include:\n\n[Setup TensorFlow for Object Detection on Ubuntu 16.04 (Part 1)](https://link.medium.com/day7JNz1kX)\n\n[Training your Object Detection model on TensorFlow (Part 2)](https://link.medium.com/gWp3OUQPkX)\n\n[Convert a TensorFlow frozen graph to a TensorFlow lite (tflite) file (Part 3)](https://link.medium.com/Nq1uaQg0kX)\n\nThis repo is currently maintained by huappe.
